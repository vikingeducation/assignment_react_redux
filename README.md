# Redux Basics

## Technologies Used
React and Redux are the primary focuses of this assignment.

## Introduction
This is a simple warm up project that looks into how to set up Redux store state for a React application. Included are two small applications that work with Redux to maintain state. The first is a small bank management app that allows a user to manage multiple accounts and deposit/withdraw money accordingly. The second is a grocery list application that allows a user to add products to their grocery list and mark them as purchased, then filter their list accordingly.

## Getting Started
Simply clone the repository, install dependencies, and use `yarn start`/`npm start` in the respective folders to view the projects.

## Deployment Links
